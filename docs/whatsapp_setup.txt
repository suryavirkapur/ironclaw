whatsapp setup for ironclawd

prerequisites
- rust toolchain installed
- valid host config at ~/.config/ironclaw/ironclawd.toml or IRONCLAWD_CONFIG

host config
[whatsapp]
enabled = true
session_dir = "data/whatsapp"
auth_method = "md5"
qr_timeout_ms = 120000
allowlist = ["+15551234567"]
self_chat_enabled = false

environment overrides
- WHATSAPP_SESSION_PATH: overrides whatsapp.session_dir

run command
cargo run -p ironclawd -- --whatsapp

qr login flow
1. start ironclawd with --whatsapp
2. wait for terminal qr rendering
3. in mobile whatsapp, open settings > linked devices > link a device
4. scan the terminal qr code
5. wait for pairing success and connected logs

session persistence
- credentials are persisted in sqlite at <session_dir>/session.db
- if session_dir ends with .db, that file path is used directly

message flow
- incoming personal chat dm is received from whatsapp websocket events
- ironclawd routes message into user session and runtime
- final assistant output is sent back to sender jid

testing checklist
- send/receive: send a dm and verify reply
- persistence: restart ironclawd and verify no new qr required
- reconnection: restart ironclawd and verify message loop resumes
