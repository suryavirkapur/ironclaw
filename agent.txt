current context:
- firecracker guest rootfs build now produces:
  - rootfs/build/guest-root (directory tree)
  - rootfs/build/guest-rootfs.ext4 (bootable ext4 image)
- guest rootfs build now copies shared libs for both busybox and irowclaw when dynamic
- default guest build now attempts x86_64-unknown-linux-musl irowclaw first
- smoke-firecracker now runs direct firecracker vsock roundtrip via common example
- common example firecracker_vsock_roundtrip validates auth handshake + streamdelta reply

pending tasks:
- run firecracker smoke on a host that allows unix socket bind syscalls
- verify successful guest boot and vsock reply outside this restricted sandbox
- keep websocket + llm integration coverage work on backlog

important decisions:
- llm network calls are host-only and keyed by openai_api_key env var
- guest must never call llm endpoints
- default host llm api is responses at https://api.openai.com/v1 with model gpt-5-mini
- firecracker rootfs default path in config is now ext4 image for direct boot

architectural notes:
- websocket payload stays messageenvelope json with payload.streamdelta for text output
- host keeps vm start and authenticated transport setup intact before ws bridge loop
- host tool request handling from guest remains wired but tool use is not initiated in step 1
- firecracker smoke path is now independent of websocket tcp bind requirements

plan:
- execute smoke-firecracker on a non-restricted host runtime to confirm full pass
- if needed, add dedicated firecracker logger path plumbing for easier guest boot debugging
