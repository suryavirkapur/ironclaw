current context:
- ironclawd now supports an optional telegram channel mvp using long polling
- telegram mode can be enabled with `--telegram` or `[telegram].enabled = true`
- telegram credentials resolve from env first (`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `OWNER_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`)
  and then from host config values
- only a single owner chat id is allowlisted; non-owner chats are ignored
- telegram updates persist offset to `data/telegram.offset`
- telegram transcripts persist per session id under users root at
  `telegram-<chat_id>/telegram.transcript.json`
- planning prompts now include last session history (rolling 50 turns) before current user input
- telegram transport failures now trigger vm teardown + restart + re-auth with one retry/backoff
- firecracker mode uses the same restart path through `start_vm_pair` + `vm_manager.stop_vm`
- guest bash now runs with working directory rooted at guest workspace (`/mnt/brain/workspace`)
- http server and telegram loop now share graceful shutdown signaling

pending tasks:
- run websocket smoke scripts on a host where tcp bind is permitted
- run manual telegram dm e2e with a real bot token and owner chat id
- confirm behavior in firecracker guest_tools mode with telegram enabled and restart retry path

important decisions:
- moved telegram session context from in-memory only to persistent per-session transcript files
- reused existing guest auth/toolcall/streamdelta flow instead of introducing a new protocol
- persisted polling offset under repository data directory for restart continuity
- used reqwest json calls directly to telegram bot api (`getUpdates`, `sendMessage`)

architectural notes:
- each chat id maps to one in-memory session (`user_id` and `session_id` as `telegram-<chat_id>`)
- each session also has a persistent transcript file and prompt history projection for host planner
- streamdelta output is chunked to 4096 chars before sendmessage requests
- guest session transport is established lazily on first owner message
- local guest mode still runs irowclaw in-process with the same transport handshake

plan:
- if needed, add webhook mode after polling mvp is validated in production-like testing
