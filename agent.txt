current context:
- execution mode routing supports host_only, guest_tools, guest_autonomous, and auto
- guest auth challenge now carries execution_mode and tool allowlist for runtime behavior
- irowclaw now enforces safety checks for prompt injection, policy decisions, and leak patterns
- guest tool registry executes allowlisted file_read and file_write under /mnt/brain/workspace
- guest handles inbound toolcallrequest and returns toolcallresponse end-to-end
- guest_tools mode asks host for tool-or-answer plan via internal host_plan tool call
- guest_autonomous mode plans and executes locally without host llm planning
- new smoke-guest-tools-ws scripts validate guest tool calls, policy block, and leak block paths

pending tasks:
- run smoke-firecracker.sh on a host where firecracker api socket bind is permitted
- run smoke-firecracker-ws.sh and smoke-guest-tools-ws.sh on a host where tcp bind is permitted
- capture pass logs for both websocket smokes on a permissive environment

important decisions:
- llm network calls are host-only and keyed by openai_api_key env var
- guest never calls external llm endpoints directly
- default host llm api is responses at https://api.openai.com/v1 with model gpt-5-mini
- guest_tools uses host_plan internal tool response for planning while guest executes tools
- guest_autonomous keeps host as websocket/protocol router only
- firecracker websocket config now pins execution_mode to guest_tools for compatibility

architectural notes:
- websocket payload stays messageenvelope json with payload.streamdelta for text output
- host keeps vm start and authenticated transport setup intact before ws bridge loop
- guest tool call trigger over websocket is available via `!toolcall <tool>\\n<input>`
- host handles internal guest tool `host_plan` and returns json action schema
- outbound guest tool and stream outputs pass through leak sanitizer before host relay

plan:
- validate websocket smoke scripts on permissive host and archive logs
- evaluate optional restricted bash tool implementation behind default-off flag
