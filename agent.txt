current context:
- completed rust-native whatsapp channel config and startup auth flow in `ironclawd`
- whatsapp config now supports `session_dir`, `auth_method`, `qr_timeout_ms`
- added runtime env override `WHATSAPP_SESSION_PATH` and session db resolution to `session.db`
- whatsapp startup now enforces md5 auth method and qr login timeout handling
- daemon cli now accepts and forwards `--whatsapp` and `--telegram` in daemon-child mode
- added whatsapp message parsing tests and setup docs in `docs/whatsapp_setup.txt`

pending tasks:
- run live whatsapp send/receive validation with a real account and qr scan
- validate restart reconnection timing and session reuse behavior under real network conditions
- add integration coverage for daemon child propagation of `--whatsapp`/`--telegram`

important decisions:
- standardized whatsapp session storage on directory-first config (`session_dir`)
- kept backward compatibility for old `session_db_path` config via serde alias
- implemented auth method guard as explicit `md5` requirement

architectural notes:
- whatsapp event loop signals auth states (`starting`, `qr`, `paired`, `connected`, `pair_failed`)
- host waits up to `whatsapp.qr_timeout_ms` before failing startup if auth is not ready
- dm ingress path remains whatsapp -> user session routing -> runtime -> whatsapp send

plan:
- run manual e2e whatsapp checklist:
  send/receive, session persistence, restart reconnection
- consider adding synthetic whatsapp transport tests with mocked event stream
