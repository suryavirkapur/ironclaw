current context:
- added shared logging stack in `crates/common/src/logging.rs` with dynamic level reload support
- host and guest config now include `log_level` with default `info`
- ironclawd now supports daemon lifecycle flags, pid files, and unix signal hooks
- host daemon config now includes pid/log path, graceful shutdown timeout, and log rotation settings
- log sink supports size/daily rotation with gzip compression and retention trimming

pending tasks:
- validate daemon behavior against a real network-enabled runtime environment
- decide if stop flow should actively wait for full process exit in non-sandbox deployments
- expand config reload scope beyond logging to full runtime mutable settings

important decisions:
- implemented shared logging in `common` so host and guest use one level model
- used runtime reload handle for log level changes on sighup
- added a no-bind daemon test mode (`IRONCLAWD_TEST_NO_BIND=1`) for integration tests under sandbox restrictions

architectural notes:
- logging initialization now happens before host runtime startup and before guest transport loop startup
- daemon start flow forks by spawning a detached child with `--daemon-child`
- stop flow reads pid file and sends sigterm; pid file cleanup is handled in stop and normal daemon teardown
- signal model: sigterm triggers shutdown path, sighup reloads host config for logging level, sigusr1 rotates logs

plan:
- monitor log rotation behavior and tune default max size/retention values from production data
- add richer daemon health probes if service supervision tooling is introduced
