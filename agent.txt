current context:
- spec v0.1.0 implementation scaffolded across common, ironclawd, irowclaw, memory, tools,
  and ui
- ironclawd serves axum http + ws, embeds ui at /ui, and bridges ws to guest transport
- irowclaw loads config from /mnt/brain/config/irowclaw.toml and initializes sqlite at
  /mnt/brain/db/ironclaw.db
- memory provides heading-aware chunking and sqlite indexing with fts5 and embeddings stub
- tools provide bash and file tool interfaces with stubs
 - next pass focuses on firecracker manager wiring, brain layout initialization, and
   vector extension stub loading

pending tasks:
- wire firecracker manager selection when enabled, with explicit error when feature missing
- ensure brain file layout files and jobs.toml are created on guest startup
- add vector extension load stub for sqlite when env configured
- tighten ws timestamp handling without unwraps

important decisions:
- sqlite remains vm-only at /mnt/brain/db/ironclaw.db
- host auth storage is separate and never shared with vm db
- config files are toml; brain layout defaults to /mnt/brain with optional env override
- local guest bridge uses in-process transport; firecracker integration is a stub feature
 - vector extension load is opt-in via env to keep sqlite-only defaults

architectural notes:
- vsock framing uses length-prefixed json envelopes
- host ws bridge translates text frames into user messages and streams json replies back
- ui assets are embedded via include_dir and served at /ui
- hybrid retrieval fusion combines lexical and semantic weights from guest config

plan:
- update ironclawd firecracker manager selection and timestamp handling
- add brain layout file initialization and jobs.toml scaffolding in irowclaw
- add sqlite vector extension load stub in memory
- update changelog for v0.1.0 adjustments
