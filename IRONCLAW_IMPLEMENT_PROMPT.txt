implement spec.md in this repo.

constraints
- rust 1.92
- toml config
- sqlite only inside guest at /mnt/brain/db/ironclaw.db
- host may have separate auth db but must not share vm db
- do not use web.run or any web lookup.
- use latest versions for dependencies by letting cargo resolve them (do not pin versions unless already pinned).

firecracker bindings
- firecracker bindings already exist in ~/Projekts/znskr-firecracker.
- prefer using that code as a local dependency or vendoring minimal parts into crates/common.
- if changes are needed in znskr-firecracker, commit them there and push to github using gh cli.

deliverables for v0.1.0
1) host daemon crate ironclawd
- axum http server
- websocket endpoint for chat streaming
- firecracker vm lifecycle management with per user brain ext4
- vsock proxy bridge host ui websocket to guest
- serve embedded ui at /ui

2) guest runtime crate irowclaw
- config loader from /mnt/brain/config/irowclaw.toml
- sovereign memory file layout under /mnt/brain
- sqlite schema with fts5 and vector extension integration stub
- hybrid retrieval fusion
- tool sandbox stubs
- scheduler jobs.toml

3) common crate
- vsock protocol types framing
- config structs
- firecracker integration surface using znskr-firecracker

4) memory crate
- markdown chunker heading aware
- indexer writes to sqlite

5) tools crate
- bash file browser tool interfaces for guest

6) ui
- scaffold placeholder only. do not add a full frontend toolchain.

workflow
- read agent.txt and changelog.txt first
- update agent.txt with concrete plan
- update changelog.txt for every modification
- implement minimal vertical slice: ironclawd can start, load config, and communicate with a stub irowclaw over a local transport. firecracker boot can be stubbed behind a feature flag.
